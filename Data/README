These data files are provided for example purposes. You can use these data to see how the compiled executables behave on your computer. Unless all the tests pass when you run RunAllTests, there is no guarantee that the behavior you get is the same as that of the developer.

== Feature-based tracker ==
The following files are used for the FeatureBasedTracker program

* test1.avi
* test1.avi.homography.txt
* test2.avi
* test2_short.avi
* test2_medium.avi
* test2.avi.homography.mat

As you can guess, these files are two groups. One group for the test1.avi video and one group for the test2.avi video.

=== Test1.avi ===
To run the implemented FeatureBasedTracking for test1.avi, try

./FeatureBasedTracking --nodebug_gui --homography_point_correspondence test1.avi test1.avi.homography.txt output.test1.avi.txt

=== Test2.avi ===
Since test2.avi is a rather long video, I have created two smaller versions:
* test2_short.avi contains the first 900 frames of test2.avi
* test2_medium.avi contains a bit more than that 

To run them

./FeatureBasedTracking --nodebug_gui --visualize_per_step test2.visualize.avi test2_short.avi test2.avi.homography.mat output.txt

or

./FeatureBasedTracking --nodebug_gui --visualize_per_step test2_medium.avi test2.avi.homography.mat output.test2.avi.txt

or

./FeatureBasedTracking --nodebug_gui --visualize_per_step test2.avi test2.avi.homography.mat output.test2.avi.txt
